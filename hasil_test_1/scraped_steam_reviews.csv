Bought Mini Motorways. Racked up 12 hours in just over 48. A superior game in almost every way and far more strategic.

76561198032898393,1,shapez,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"TL: DR - A relaxed but still thinky, stripped back version of Factorio without the stress. So good! More detail: I really enjoyed Factorio, but barely scratched the surface of that game and permanently melted my brain in the process. Shapes.io is that game stripped back to the basics without the stress of resources and enemies. for a few bucks, it is hands down a satisfying and rewarding game. It is the kind of game you could spend hours on in one sitting perfecting, refining and developing your already built sections, or simply ploughing ahead on the next crazy combination of shapes and colours. Made a mistake? Who cares. No limits on resources means mistakes are ok. I have seen that there may be changes to this in the future and hopefully the developers make the game customisable, because this is my go to game when I have 10-15 minutes to fill, even though I am happy to sit and play it for extended periods also. Don't get me wrong, lack of stress does not equal simple. The game requires you to think, but it builds slowly so you can adapt to each new challenge in turn. Great fun!",19.9 hrs on record																					(16.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,1,Aven Colony,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Only played it for 3 hours so far but it reminds me of several other games put together. It reminds me a lot of Cliff Empire, which I love (the balancing of resources, food variation, weather conditions and drone management), Surviving Mars, which I love (building ranges, weather events, building connections, citizen traits etc) and the Tropico series, which I love (referendums, building types). Whilst I don't love this yet, I am curious to see where it takes me as I play out the campaign. To me, the comparison is much closer to Cliff Empire, which in my humble opinion is a sorely underrated strategic city builder. But so far, this seems more relaxing as without good planning, Cliff Empire can be a real struggle to make ends (resources and cash) meet. If you like any of the games I've mentioned to far, I'm tipping this will suit you too, although I am still questioning what it is adding if it really is just a sum of parts from those other games.",10.1 hrs on record																					(3.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,1,The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game - Definitive Edition,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"I own the physical copy of the LCG board game and some reviews here put me off getting this because it was not the same. But it is very very similar in many ways and the core mechanics are the same so if that's what's stopping you, don't let it. The differences, from what I can see, are welcomed and actually add to the experience that you wouldn't get in the real life game. To add, I normally hate unlocking cards and I normally am never a completionist, nor do I care about achievements or the like. But in the 4 hours I've played, I have simply only been tackling the final tutorial mission repeatedly with different heroes to gain bonuses to unlock cards but also to see how they play. There are no expansions as of yet, but I will be getting quite a few hours out of this given the number of heroes, sufficient quests and 3 levels of difficulty. Maybe not quite worth fill price assuming more DLCs will (hopefully) come out, but definitely worth getting on sale if you are a fan of the physical game or games like this.",11.1 hrs on record																					(4.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,1,Motorsport Manager,"Racing, Simulation, Sports, Strategy",Recommended,"I used to LOVE Football Manager around ten years ago when the level of complexity was good. It was not a case of simply picking a side and a tactic and watching the game play. There were lots of elements to play with but you felt that each played a role in the outcome of your matches, season and career. Then it got bogged down in all sorts of issues and many people, myself included, felt we had no idea if ANYTHING was making a difference. So why am I saying this in the Motorsport Manager review? Because this is sitting in the same field as that FM2006 era. Man this game is fun. If you like management games that are meaty but not stupidly convoluted, this is your game. If you like motorsport and are willing to control tactics but not the actual drive through intuitive systems and mechanics, this is your game. I can only comment on one  type of racing (open wheel etc) as I have a career going in one only, but I am riding the emotions like I did with the ol' FM. And after 5 or 6 seasons, there does not seem to be a simple system to winning races or championships The replayability is awesome as political sessions that you can be involved in change the rules of the season - tyre types, practice session lengths, car specs (general ones for those who are like me and know little about the actual cars themselves) are all up for change each year. If you are on the fence, love management games (Even if you are not a big petrol head) you enjoy this one!",108.0 hrs on record																					(71.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,1,Town of Salem,"Action, Casual, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"I have not purchased a game where I have sat and played for 6+ hours in one sitting in a LONG time. I great hidden role game with lots of depth. I will say that it is difficult to learn at first and the different roles are hard to keep up with, especially as more experienced players know them well and have their own lingo which can be confusing. The tutorial is bare to say the least, but it's not that hard to figure out overall. There are plenty of new people at the moment and most community members seem helpful and willing to teach (once they are dead!!!). The game can be slow at times, but it is still intriguing to watch the game unfold even after you have died (plus you may be brought back to life or spoken to by the medium, giving you still more to do). The only real negative is that I walked around the supermarket afterwards, wondering who I should kill, lynch and generally assessed everyone to see who was being suspiscious.",14.9 hrs on record																					(14.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,1,Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Really liking this game! If you are a fan of deck builders, you will enjoy this. Some great combos and strategy here without being too thinky. You will need to plan your purchases and manage your income, watch the opponent and distribute damage well. Some games it will be clear who will win halfway through, yet no-one i've played with has quit yet and there have been several come from behind wins (for and gainst me!). Tutorial is clear and the AI is a good enough challenge to learn the ropes. I've had to wait no more than 20-30 seconds to get an opponent online. Lotsa fun....one more game kind of stuff!",12.5 hrs on record																					(6.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,1,TASTEE: Lethal Tactics,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"I've only played a couple of hours as I type this review and I am a little hesitant to give it too much praise or criticism. The comparisons to Frozen Synapse and Door Kickers is spot on  - that's what this is. In all honsety, I have purchased it becasue I LOVE Frozen Synapse but their servers are dead and I am keenly waiting for Frozen Synapse 2 to be released later this year. So Tastee is a bit of a bridge to that time. For anyone who has played Frozen Synapse, it's very much the same but with better graphics and a few different variances to the class types. I have found a couple of issues with multiplayer (where it commited my turns before I did anything, another where it would not let me assign any orders to anyone for no reason) but overall, it's intuitive for those who have played similar such games. Like FS, you can have multiple multiplayer games go on at once - soemthing that may make or break people as the games can go over the course of days (think email chess).",9.5 hrs on record																					(6.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,1,Prison Architect,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested. The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought ""I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and..."" - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!). - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on. - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge Take or leaves: - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again. Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found. - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway). Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course). Very much recommended.",81.4 hrs on record																					(59.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,1,Factorio,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Let's cut to the chase: - I don't know what I am doing - I am in over my depth - My head is spinning trying to solve a problem in the game - to solve one problem, there are another 3 to solve before you can address that one - From what I have seen, i have only scratched the surface - I will probably never be good at the game as I don't have the time to really delve into it - I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ABOVE BECASUE I AM LOVING THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!! Factorio is addictive. As I have stated, I have really only scratched the surface of the game. I have really tried hard to avoid looking up any tutorials or YouTube clips and so far have stuck to that fairly well. I want to figure this stuff out myself. So, that said, I am still on the second or third level of the campaign - something but probably should only take about half an hour (? no idea - never compared to anything) but I am easily up to 10+hours just on that alone (and I now think I need to start again!) The game will do your head in but in a good way. There is something very rewarding about nutting out a manufacturing chain that works. Watching all your bits humm along and progress is made. The tutorial is ok, it gives you enough but it's not a lot. Kinda like saying, ""Did you know nuclear power is very complicated. Now, here's some uranium and some bricks, off you go then!"" That said, it worked. The campaign ramps things up significantly and seems to act as a more advanced tutorial. BUt this ain't baby steps, more like giant leaps. BUt it has worked and I am loving the challnege. When I couldn't figure out one thing, I looked at some YouTube clips and saw technologies and features WAAAAAAAY beyond what I am up to - and I already feel barely in control. The crafting system is pretty easy and unlike other crafting based games, you don't need to use time wasting trial and error to discover recipes. They are all there which makes things so much easier. Want to build an ""x""? Hover over the icon and it will tell you it needs some ""a's"" and ""b's"" to make it. It gets tricky when the ""a's"" need ""c's"" and ""d's"" to be built and thus, the complexity and mind breaking begins. You will love this game if you like exploratory, survival, crafting games that really make you think. As I said in my intro, I won't ever be an expert a tthe game but I am loving the almost perfect learning curve - it's hard but not alienating. I'm NEVER bored. It's not treating me like a baby with breadcrumbs through every possible action. Let's be honest, there is a lot this game does not tell you, but it's not impossible for a regular Joe like me to nut it out...eventually. Can't wait to see where this game goes....scared to see where this game goes given what it has already!",30.9 hrs on record																					(21.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,2,Wreckfest,"Action, Indie, Racing, Simulation, Sports",Recommended,"Oh how I want to love htis game and recommend it to others. But sadly I cannot. I purchased this a long time ago during the early access period. The game was an exceptionally fun smash and crash racing/derby game, a modern take on the fun that was Destruction Derby. The cras were arcady enough to handle, real enough to lose control when hit well. They were fast and manouevreable and the choas that followed wes gold. Made some friends through this game and we had a blast for a few months. BUT... things have changed. The game has become more or a simulation and the cars are now heavy and the game feels slow. Hitting another car seems to not be satsifying anymore, like hitting a concrete wall with a foam swimming noodle, it just doesn't do much. It seems to be turning more into a racing sim and team career managment game than...well...a wreckfest. Don't get me wrong, if you like a good, semi-realistic game with wearing parts and accurate handling, then this might tickle your fancy for a while. But if you wanted a game where you could jump in, smash stuff up using skill and gile and have a blast without it feeling too arcady, then this is not the game for you...at least not any more or at the moment.",117.1 hrs on record																					(38.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,2,Cities: Skylines,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"What an awesome game! For ANYONE who loves city builders, this is the one to get! It has had some criticism for lack of disasters and ""challenges"" and yes, once you get your finances sorted and flowing, money tends not to be an issue. BUt, like any sandbox game, you make issues out of what you want. For many, it is traffic and public transport. Fact is, the game looks great. You will admire your city for ages. The DLCs add a lot and there looks like more to come. I'd highly recommend some traffic control mods to assist you in your traffic problems though. Easy to learn, a pleasure to play. It's a game that will have you think, but won't have you stressed when errors are made. Challenging without huritng. SImply the best city builder I've ever played and will continue to put hours into it in the future!",102.3 hrs on record																					(82.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,2,Rocket League®,"Action, Indie, Racing, Sports",Recommended,"Buy it. Say goodbye to friends and family. Buy it now. Prepare for adrenaline rush to be your normal state. Seriously, buy it now!! You're still reading. Fine, here's more detail... This game is easy to get the hang of. A great tutorial, excellent training for all abilities and you'll be in an online game with confidence within minutes. And you'll be a hero in that game...only seconds before you are a schmuck! If you have read any negative reviews from people who have played for an hour or so, ignore them. This game is easy to get to grips with, bloody hard to master and even if you are nailing all the training, the sheer tension of a split second opportunity will have your heart racing and make you look like a hero or villain a thousand times over per game. The five minute time length is perfect. You may score/conceed 8+ goals in that time depending on how well your 'team' is playing. It's long enough to make an epic battle but not too long to warrant too many rage quitters (although there are some softies out there!). There's no classes of vehicle, no power ups (outside of fast regenerating boost discs that everyone can access) which is great, as it makes YOU the difference and not the make up of your car or any bonuses you may have collected. I can't say enough wonderful things about this game. often 50,000-90,000 people online at any one time means an online game is (almost) always good to go. Soooooo much fun and LOADS of replayabilitly despite pretty much no difference in cars or arenas other than looks - just the way it needs to be! 10/10 - unbeliveably fun!","1,753.5 hrs on record																					(50.8 hrs at review time)",N/A
76561198032898393,2,Offworld Trading Company,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"This review is an early access one and even within days of me buying the game some significant changes were made, so I expect lots more changes to come. This is one really good concept and whilst there are issues with it (especially in teaching a new player how to play and how the systems and concepts work), there is soooo much to like here. The game does away with military conflict and the necessity to be able to hotkey or mouse-click quickly to win. Instead, it requires forethought, palnning, deception and a little luck to do well. I'll admit, it took me ages to get my head around some concepts and I'm not sure I'm there yet. I have yet to play a multiplayer game (this is my major criticism at this stage - no-one online at this point but hopefully numbers will grow) and have only just started a campaign, but I've already put in 14 hours at the point of writing this in skirmishe and doing the tutorial a couple of times. There are some really interesting game features too, such as being able to play a single player skirmish while you wait for a multiplayer lobby to fill (which helps avoid the hwole thing where people log on, check for ten seconds and then leave), a team based multiplayer option and a single player mode that works differently to the multi and skirmish modes. Pros: - Great amount of tension within the game - Replayablility Every game is different - Accomodates various playing styles (with 4 different bases/classes that are reasonably balanced at this point) - shrewed tactical gameplay - Various gameplay options across all game modes - Games last for between 15 minutes and half hour. Not a Civ styled game at all. Cons: - Tough to learn. The turoial is pretty much non-existant and many finer points that will have you scratching your head will not be answered without visiting the internets and YouTube - No-one on multiplayer yet Overall: I feel like I am only at the beginning of this journey with this game and  with updates that make the game a little more unique on each play, the game will go from strength to strength. It is fair enough to say that I am a fan!",79.9 hrs on record																					(16.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198032898393,2,"Invisible, Inc.","Action, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"This was one surprise of a game for me. The concept sounded good, but I figured it might be one of those games that you really need to invest loads of time into to learn all the various parts, skills, techs and strategies. Far from it! The game mechanics are simple enough and there's not a lot here that will confuse people (although some perks are a little unclear as to what they do) but man, it will challenge you! The game is challenging and your death and demise is ALWAYS your fault! There is no luck here. Laziness and lack of forethought will be your undoing. That's the beauty of this game. Randomly generated levels combined with solid game rules and permadeth equals loads of replayability and agonising consequences for screwing up. If you like games where it's all about planning without the effect of luck, undpredicatble levels and the risk of losing with one mistake, this is for you. It's not a shooter, in fact, that's your last and often unwanted resort. It's a stealth game to the max and it teases you with the random levels, as sooooo many times I've died just wanting to explore that next room, even though I've completed my mission and the exit is JUST THERE!!! Do you leave an unconscious agent so at least your game can continue, or or do you attempt to strategically resue them knowing that the gaurd numbers ar eincreasing and that they will find you eventually. Great game. If you love strategy and stealth, do not hesitate. One of the best pickups I've had in years. Updates are pretty regular, and I have had zero bugs that I am aware of.

76561198032898393,2,Frozen Synapse,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"I love this game! No luck, simple mechanics but loads of strategy. A pretty easy game to get your head around (I recommend looking up a combat guide or game mechnics wiki as some aspects are not clear in game) but bloody hard to master. A really simple concept that creates a guge amount of tension. Seems like a lot of players have dropped of, maybe in favour of Frozen Synapse Prime, so finding a game to play then and there can be hard depending on when you log in. That said, there is no issue with playing a game for a few minutes every day over a couple of various games you have going, so long as they finish! Awesome game that will have you thinking and there's endless replay value to be had here. There is nothing better than outsmarting the person becasue you knew they would know that you knew they would know what you were going to do and catered for that with a stragtegic move from hell!
